## Why should I make it
 As a result of work on the test task, a library was developed that is a wrapper over Selenium.
 This library simulates user actions. And it can facilitate the development of an application for interacting with a web resource.
 
## What does the solution consist of
 The solution consists of two projects: a launcher and a library. 
 The most interesting library project. The library uses templates: a builder and a template method.
